The plugin hides post and comment publishing dates from Google.

== Description ==

The plugin uses a CSS hack to show the date â€“ your visitors see it, but Google takes it for the "title" parameter of a "span" element and does not consider it to be a part of the page content. Therefore, the publishing date is not shown in the search snippet.

The plugin works with <strong>ALL</strong> themes now (from version 2.00).
